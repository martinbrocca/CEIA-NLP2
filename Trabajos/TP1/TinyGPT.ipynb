        "#### 1. *Greedy Decoding: falla por repeticion**\n",
        "- En el modelo de greedy, se produce la falla por colapso repetitivo: \"the the the the...\". Esto sucede tanto en el modelo entrenado con 2 como el de 50 epochs.\n",
        "- Esto es un problema comun en la generacion autoregresiva: Una vez seleccionado un token con la maxima probabilidad, se crea un contexto que hace que ese mismo token sea el proximo\n",
        "- **Conclusion**: Greedy decoding no es una buena solucion para generacion de texto open-ended.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Efectos de la temperature**\n",
        "- **Temperatura 0.5**: Mas conservativo, pero aun propenso a la repeticion.\n",
        "- **Temperatura 1.0**: Baseline sampling, es la funcion generate original.\n",
        "- **Temperatura 1.5**: Alcanza la diversidad maxima, al costo de sacrificar coherencia.\n",
        "- **Best practice**: Una temperature 0.7-1.0 for creative text generation\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Performance Top-k vs Top-p**\n",
        "- **Top-k (k=5)**: Provee una buena diversidad al tiempo que evita tokens poco probables.\n",
        "- **Top-p (p=0.9)**: Se adapta mejor a las probabilidades de distribucion.\n",
        "- Ambos metodos de generacion evitan el problema de colapso repetitivo visto con el greeding decoding.\n",
        "- **Conclusion**: Top-p se presenta como una solucion levemente mas coherente para este modelo.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Observaciones del entrenamiento del modelo**\n",
        "- El modelo reconoce a los personajes de Shakespeare correctamente (SICINIUS, VICOLANIUS de Coriolanus)\n",
        "- Se ve que el modelo intenta imitar el estilo de escritura de Shakespeare (nombrando personajes, formato de dialogo)\n",
        "- Con solo 2 epochs, el modelo no ha aprendido la correcta formacion de palabras.\n",
        "- Con 50 epochs, ya comienzan a verse palabras bien formadas, pero continua la invencion de palabas.\n",
        "- en ambos casos, las reglas de puntuacion y uso de mayusculas se han aprendido antes que la correcta escritura de palabras.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Cache Performance**\n",
        "- Todos los metodos usan currectamente `use_cache=True`\n",
        "- La velocidad de generacion es similar en todos los modelos.\n",
        "- Los mecanismos de cache trabajan correctamente con todas las estrategias de muestreo.\n"
